## Codebase Patterns
- User registration uses `registerUser` action in `src/lib/actions/auth.ts`
- Default categories are seeded via `seedDefaultCategories` function
- Password hashing uses bcryptjs with 10 rounds
- Prisma client uses better-sqlite3 adapter with file-based database
- Run TypeScript files with `npx tsx <file>`
- Transaction amounts are stored in cents (multiply dollars by 100)
- CategoryType enum: 'income' and 'expense' (lowercase)

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Created 5 test user accounts with seeded default categories
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-test-users.ts` (new file) - Seed script for test users
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with new users
- Test users created:
  - testuser1@example.com (Sarah Johnson)
  - testuser2@example.com (Michael Chen)
  - testuser3@example.com (Emily Rodriguez)
  - testuser4@example.com (James Wilson)
  - testuser5@example.com (Amanda Foster)
- All accounts use password: admin123
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The dev server runs on port 3000 by default
  - Each user gets 11 default categories (4 income + 7 expense)
  - Browser verification confirmed: login works and redirects to dashboard

## 2026-02-01 - US-002
- What was implemented: Populated 59 transactions for Sarah Johnson (freelancer)
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-sarah-transactions.ts` (new file) - Seed script for Sarah's transactions
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with transactions
- Transaction breakdown:
  - 16 income transactions (freelance payments $500-5000)
  - 43 expense transactions (rent, utilities, food, software, equipment, etc.)
  - Total income: $50,024.00
  - Total expenses: $12,923.96
- All transactions have realistic descriptions and dates distributed across 6 months
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Amounts in the database are stored in cents (multiply dollars by 100)
  - Use `prisma.transaction.create()` directly for seeding (no auth needed)
  - Get category IDs by querying user's categories first
  - CategoryType enum values are 'income' and 'expense' (lowercase)
