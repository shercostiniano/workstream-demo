## Codebase Patterns
- User registration uses `registerUser` action in `src/lib/actions/auth.ts`
- Default categories are seeded via `seedDefaultCategories` function
- Password hashing uses bcryptjs with 10 rounds
- Prisma client uses better-sqlite3 adapter with file-based database
- Run TypeScript files with `npx tsx <file>`
- Transaction amounts are stored in cents (multiply dollars by 100)
- CategoryType enum: 'income' and 'expense' (lowercase)
- InvoiceStatus enum: 'draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'cancelled' (lowercase)
- Invoice line items use unitPrice in cents and quantity

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Created 5 test user accounts with seeded default categories
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-test-users.ts` (new file) - Seed script for test users
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with new users
- Test users created:
  - testuser1@example.com (Sarah Johnson)
  - testuser2@example.com (Michael Chen)
  - testuser3@example.com (Emily Rodriguez)
  - testuser4@example.com (James Wilson)
  - testuser5@example.com (Amanda Foster)
- All accounts use password: admin123
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The dev server runs on port 3000 by default
  - Each user gets 11 default categories (4 income + 7 expense)
  - Browser verification confirmed: login works and redirects to dashboard
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-002
- What was implemented: Populated 59 transactions for Sarah Johnson (freelancer)
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-sarah-transactions.ts` (new file) - Seed script for Sarah's transactions
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with transactions
- Transaction breakdown:
  - 16 income transactions (freelance payments $500-5000)
  - 43 expense transactions (rent, utilities, food, software, equipment, etc.)
  - Total income: $50,024.00
  - Total expenses: $12,923.96
- All transactions have realistic descriptions and dates distributed across 6 months
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Amounts in the database are stored in cents (multiply dollars by 100)
  - Use `prisma.transaction.create()` directly for seeding (no auth needed)
  - Get category IDs by querying user's categories first
  - CategoryType enum values are 'income' and 'expense' (lowercase)

## 2026-02-01 - US-003
- What was implemented: Populated 35 transactions for Michael Chen (salaried employee)
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-michael-transactions.ts` (new file) - Seed script for Michael's transactions
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with transactions
- Transaction breakdown:
  - 7 income transactions (6 monthly salaries of $4500 + Q4 bonus of $2000)
  - 28 expense transactions (rent, utilities, food, transportation, entertainment, healthcare)
  - Total income: $29,000.00
  - Total expenses: $16,454.00
  - Net: $12,546.00
- Consistent monthly pattern: Salary on the 1st, rent on the 1st, utilities mid-month
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use fixed dates for consistent recurring transactions (e.g., salary on 1st)
  - Salaried users have more predictable patterns than freelancers

## 2026-02-01 - US-004
- What was implemented: Populated 73 transactions for Emily Rodriguez (business owner)
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-emily-transactions.ts` (new file) - Seed script for Emily's transactions
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with transactions
- Transaction breakdown:
  - 31 income transactions (consulting fees $2000-8000, product sales $500-2000)
  - 42 expense transactions (office rent $800, utilities, supplies, marketing, contractor payments)
  - Total income: $100,241.00
  - Total expenses: $24,098.00
  - Net: $76,143.00
- Mix of business consulting income and product sales with variable amounts
- Business expenses include: office rent, utilities, marketing, contractor payments, professional services
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Business owners have more varied income sources than salaried employees
  - Use "Freelance" category for consulting income, "Other Income" for product sales
  - Use "Other Expense" category for business-specific expenses like marketing and contractor payments

## 2026-02-01 - US-005
- What was implemented: Populated 43 transactions for James Wilson (part-time worker)
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-james-transactions.ts` (new file) - Seed script for James's transactions
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with transactions
- Transaction breakdown:
  - 12 income transactions (biweekly part-time wages $800-1500)
  - 31 expense transactions (rent $900, food $200-300, transportation, utilities, healthcare, emergencies)
  - Total income: $14,393.00
  - Total expenses: $9,584.00
  - Net: $4,809.00
- Financial stress demonstrated:
  - December 2025: Income $1,658, Expenses $1,940, Net -$282 (DEFICIT)
  - October 2025: Income $1,781, Expenses $1,921, Net -$140 (DEFICIT)
- Reduced income months simulate missed work due to illness, scheduling issues
- Emergency expenses (car repair, urgent care, holiday gifts) create stress months
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - To create financial stress, reduce income AND add unexpected expenses in same month
  - Part-time workers have variable income due to scheduling/hours fluctuations
  - Emergency expenses (car repair, medical) are realistic causes of financial stress

## 2026-02-01 - US-006
- What was implemented: Created 5 invoices for Emily Rodriguez (testuser3@example.com)
- Files changed:
  - `prisma/seed-emily-invoices.ts` (new file) - Seed script for Emily's invoices
  - `dev.db` - Database updated with invoices and invoice items
- Invoice breakdown:
  - INV-2026-0001: Tech Innovations LLC - Draft - $5,500.00 (2 items)
  - INV-2026-0002: Global Solutions Inc - Sent - $7,500.00 (3 items)
  - INV-2026-0003: StartupXYZ - Sent (overdue) - $5,150.00 (3 items)
  - INV-2026-0004: Acme Industries - Paid - $8,100.00 (3 items)
  - INV-2026-0005: Digital Dynamics Corp - Cancelled - $3,000.00 (3 items)
- Total invoice value: $29,250.00
- Each invoice has realistic client names/emails and consulting service line items
- Browser verification: All 5 invoices displayed correctly with proper status badges
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Invoice model uses `InvoiceStatus` enum: draft, sent, paid, cancelled
  - Invoice amounts are also in cents (unitPrice field in InvoiceItem)
  - Use nested `items: { create: [...] }` in Prisma to create related InvoiceItems
  - Check for existing invoices before seeding to avoid duplicates
